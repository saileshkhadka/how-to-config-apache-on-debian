#Virtual Host Configuration
#configuration files stores in /etc/apache2 directory.

#main config file is /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

#Apache will listen to specified port in /etc/apache2/ports.conf file.

#Apache Virtual Hosts files are located in the /etc/apache2/sites-available directory

#You can activate a virtual host directive by creating a symlink using the a2ensite command from the configuration files found in the sites-available directory to the sites-enabled directory.
# To deactivate a virtual host use the a2dissite command.

# if your domain name is mydomain.com then the domain configuration file should be named
 /etc/apache2/sites-available/mydomain.com.conf

#Files containing global configuration fragments are stored in the /etc/apache2/conf-available directory

#Apache log files (access.log and error.log) are located in the /var/log/apache directory. It is recommended to use different access and error log files for each virtual host.

#The most common locations for webroot include:
/home/<user_name>/<site_name>
/var/www/<site_name>
/var/www/html/<site_name>
/opt/<site_name>

#You can now start deploying your applications and use Apache as a web or proxy server
